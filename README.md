# acropup AdBlock Filters

***NOTE:** I have since come to favour writing UserScripts for the Stylus extension instead of relying wholly on AdBlock filters. The new repo is [acropup-UserStyle-CSS-Scripts](https://github.com/acropup/acropup-userstyle-css-scripts). There will be some overlap in features between these two repositories, but most of my work going forward will be done as UserScripts, especially when the changes are more substantial and CSS is the rational choice.*

This is a compilation of custom uBlock filters that make websites I use less annoying. Beyond simple ad-blocking, some sites are too distracting or inconvenient to use as provided, and some features are of no interest to me and just take up space and detract from the content. These are primarily of personal interest in making the internet more pleasant for me to use, but feel free to ask questions or provide additional filters or feedback and I will consider making changes.

These filters should work for AdBlock, AdBlock Plus, uBlock, uBlock Origin, etc., as the [syntax for filters](https://adblockplus.org/filters) is universally compatible, as far as I know.

To Include these filters in your AdBlock plugin of choice, the direct URLs are like this:
